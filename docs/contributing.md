# Contributing
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍  

All help big or small are very welcome.
Even the smallest contribution like fixing a spelling error makes the
application better and better for each commit.

For information about how to compile, release and test the application
have a look at the [developmont](development.md). Its quite easy to get
started I hope as this is a small and simple application.
