<h3>Domain Services</h3>

<p>"A SERVICE is an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model,
    without encapsulating state, as ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS do" [Evans 2003].
</p>

<p>
    The above defines what a Domain Service is. Any behaviour, operation or activity that cannot
    logically fit into an Object is a good candidate for being exposed as a service.
    However the important thing to note here is that the Service being exposed should represent a domain concept.
    This ensures you don't get carried away and create tons of services with very less entities and vo's.
    Rules to be followed by Domain Services
</p>

<p>A domain service has to abide by only 2 cardinal principles</p>
<ul>
    <li>It has to be stateless</li>
    <li>It should have some meaning in domain e.g. AccountTransferService, AdjustOrderService etc</li>
</ul>
